# Simple Orbital Mechanics Toolbox

Welcome to this straightforward Python toolbox for orbital mechanics! This repository features a lean and clean set of Python scripts that handle everything from orbital element conversion to celestial body visualization. Even if you're new to this field, you'll find these scripts intuitive and easy to use.

## Included Scripts
- **`kep_xyz.py`**: Converts Keplerian elements to Cartesian coordinates.
- **`xyz_kep.py`**: Transforms Cartesian coordinates to Keplerian elements.
- **`radec_xyz.py`**: Computes right ascension and declination from Cartesian coordinates.
- **`Orbit_coordinates.py`**: General utility functions for orbital coordinates.
- **`X0487_Plot.py`**: Simple Python script to plot example data.

## Features
- **Ease of Use**: Designed with simplicity in mind. No steep learning curve.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for amateur astronomers, students, or anyone with a keen interest in space.
- **Reliable**: Code has been tested for precise celestial positioning.
